# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on TV Data

This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects conducted on TV data using Python and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis focused on exploring and cleaning three datasets:

1. **halftime_musicians.csv**: This dataset contains information about halftime musicians for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.
2. **super_bowls.csv**: This dataset includes game data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.
3. **tv.csv**: This dataset provides TV data related to Super Bowl viewership, TV ratings, and ad costs.

The analysis aimed to answer various questions related to Super Bowl events and their impact on television viewership. Some of the questions addressed during the analysis include:

- What are the most extreme game outcomes?
- How does the game affect television viewership?
- How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad costs evolved over time?
- Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

The analysis involved data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization to uncover insights and trends in Super Bowl events and their associated TV data.

## Project Structure

- **halftime_musicians.csv**: Contains information about halftime musicians.
- **super_bowls.csv**: Includes game data for all Super Bowls.
- **tv.csv**: Provides TV data related to Super Bowl viewership, TV ratings, and ad costs.
- **notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file containing the code and analysis for EDA on TV data.

Feel free to explore the analysis in the notebook.ipynb file, which includes detailed code implementations, visualizations, and insights derived from the datasets.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out. Happy exploring!
