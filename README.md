## YouTube Statistics Project

**Overview**
This project was conducted using Python in Jupyter Notebook. The main objective was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on YouTube statistics data obtained from a CSV file.

**Methodology**
- Data Collection: The data was obtained from a CSV file containing YouTube statistics.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Various aspects of the data were explored, including views, likes, dislikes, and comments.
- Data Filtering: Pandas library was utilized to filter and extract the necessary data for analysis.
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib.pyplot and Seaborn libraries were employed to create visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots to better understand the data distribution and patterns.
- Insights: Insights and observations were provided through comments within the Jupyter Notebook and visually represented in the plots.

**Files**
- Notebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code and analysis.
- Global YouTube Statistics.csv: CSV file containing the raw dataset used for analysis.

**Libraries Used**
- Pandas
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Seaborn
